Energy Saving Examples
	LARA strategies applied to smart navigation system
	Probabilistic Time-Dependent Routing -- PTDR
	Betweenness Centrality -- BC

PTDR - Strategy
	Automatic exploration of the design space
		variables: threads and samples
		metrics: time, energy, power and error
	Informed choice of tradeoffs (Pareto frontier)
	Possible to autotune and adapt at runtime
	
	[LARA sample]

PTDR - Results
	[images]

BC - Strategy
	Skip expensive computation if result can be approximated
	Assumption: if inputs are similar, the outputs are similar
	Much less expensive to compare inputs than to compute BC

	[pseudo codes]
	
BC - Results

	[results]

	With T=2 we skip around 24% of the BC computations
	From OpenMP to Skip:
		speedup of 1.32
		energy consumption improvement of 24.79%
