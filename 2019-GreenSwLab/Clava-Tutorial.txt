Examples Outline


1.1) Call Graph
	Build a static call graph from the application source
	Superset of the dynamic call graph
	Edges indicate how many times a call appears in the code
	
	Strategy:
		Select all methods (caller) and the calls inside (callee)
		Make <caller, callee> tuples
		Generate a graph, in dot format, with the tuples
	
	[cg.dot.svg]


1.2) Static Report
	Generate a report about the application
		Number of files, functions and calls
		Number and types of loops
		Caller<->Callee information
		
	Strategy:
		Select files,functions and calls to count
		Select loops and query their type
		Get <caller, callee> tuples
		Print reports [using JS]
	
	[explain how this could be extended and segue into the specs docs]


2.1) Logging with Inserts
	Log certain execution events
		Start of loops
		Entering functions
	
	Strategy:
		Select loops and their parent file
		Insert logging code before loop
		Add header include at the start of the file
		Select functions and their parent file
		Insert logging code at the start of the function body
		Add header include at the start of the file

	[present the first use of actions, insert and addInclude]
	[present and explain codedef]

Code Insertion in Clava/LARA
	insert injects literal code into the application
	Upsides: extremely versatile, can insert any code you want
	Downsides: cumbersome (\n), error prone (code might have errors)
	How to mitigate:
		codedef
		option to verify syntax
		[segue into APIs]


2.2) Logging with APIs
	Log certain execution events (a more complex example) [explain that the first part is the same]
	Make use of Clava APIs
	
	Strategy:
		Same as before for functions
		Look for writes to variables inside a specific function
		Filter variables based on type
		Log when the writing happens using the Logger API
	
	[explain imports (user and Clava)]
	[introduce Clava APIs (explain the idea is to declare your intentions, not to specify how to do them: multi-lang and multi-implementation)]
	[introduce and show Clava Doc]



2.3) Measurements
	Collect metrics on certain events or around pieces of code
	Measure execution time and energy consumption
	
	Strategy:
		Capture loops inside a specific function
		Call APIs to measure around the selected loops
		
	[API allows us to abstract from target language, show C and C++ generated code]
	[show that rapl header was included automatically and explain the API that performs this]
	[mention the extreme multi-lang case where this exact aspect can be used in Java (got to Kadabra)]

3.1) Gprofer
	Profile an application using gprof
	This can be the start of your analysis and optimization cycle
	
	Strategy:
		Import and configure Gprofer
		Profile the application
		Get hotspot and its gprof information

	[stress this returns a function join point, which can be used with all aspects we've seen so far]
	[it can be used to start a more refined search inside the hotspot or passed to other aspects that automatically transform the code]
	
	
3.2) AutoPar
	Improve execution performance with OpenMP
	Free the user from analysis

	Strategy:
		Select target loop based on pragma [explain why this is important (show also the original code)]
		Call AutoPar API to parallelize the target loop
	
	[stress that analysis is performed automatically and the library decides what and how to parallelize]


3.3) Exploration
	Perform a design space exploration on an OpenMP application
	This can be the output of AutoPar
	Automatically explore the number of threads (could explore other parameters)
	
	Strategy:
		Import and use LAT to define a variable range for the thread exploration
		Configure compilation options (in this case, activate OpenMP) [explain the cmaker library]
		Define the scope where LAT will perform changes
		Define the scope where LAT will collect metrics
		Start the exploration
		
	[take some time to explain LAT: what it does automatically and in what cases it can be used]
	[segue into a more complex exploration that cannot be performed with LAT]


3.4) Loop Interchange Exploration
	Apply loop interchange to a matrix multiplication kernel
	Automatically explore what the best permutation is
	Use some more Clava APIs
	
	Strategy:
		Generate all possible interchange permutations and for each:
			Apply interchange
			Add code to measure execution time
			Compile and execute the application
			Save the results
		Print the results
